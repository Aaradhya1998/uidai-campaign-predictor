Predicting effective outreach campaigns using Aadhaar age demographics
# UIDAI Campaign Predictor 📊

This project predicts the most effective outreach campaign
for different Indian states using Aadhaar age demographic data.

The goal is to help policymakers design age-targeted awareness
campaigns for maximum reach and impact.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Government campaigns are often launched uniformly across regions.
However, population age distribution varies significantly by state.

This project uses age-based Aadhaar data to predict which type of
campaign would be most effective for a given state.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- State-wise Aadhaar age demographic data
- Age groups segmented into meaningful ranges
- Data preprocessed and cleaned before modeling

> *Note: Dataset used for educational and analytical purposes.*

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model training
- Performance evaluation

---

## 🧠 Model Used
- Machine Learning classification model  
- Trained to map age demographics to campaign categories

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Different states show distinct age-group dominance
- Campaign strategies can be tailored state-wise
- Model provides interpretable predictions
